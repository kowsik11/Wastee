# 👋 Hey, I'm Sai — Builder • Engineer • Indie Founder

I'm the kind of person who builds the tools everyone else wishes existed.

Deeply technical. Relentlessly entrepreneurial. I design, develop, and ship AI-first products end-to-end — from prompt to product, from backend to UX. I believe in building fast, shipping sharp, and solving real-world problems with software that *actually* works.

## 💡 Why I Build

- I don’t build demos. I build stuff people actually need.  
- Every project I work on is real, solves a real workflow, or saves someone hours per week.  
- I use agents, APIs, and AI not as buzzwords — but as tools to get real shit done.  

I ship fast. I don’t wait for perfect. If the problem is clear, I’m already building the solution.

## 🧱 Philosophy & Workflow

- 💥 Build fast, polish later.  
- 🧵 Ship in threads. Talk in code.  
- 🔁 Feedback loop: user pain → prototype → iterate  
- 🧠 Agents > apps. APIs > GUIs.  
- ✂️ Cut bloat. Cut friction. Cut excuses.  

---

## 🎯 GitHub Goals

- 🔓 Open-source more of my agent infrastructure  
- 🔧 Contribute to projects like `responsively-org` and LangChain  
- 🧱 Build in public, one atomic commit at a time  
- 👨‍🔧 Collaborate with other devs, founders, and toolmakers
